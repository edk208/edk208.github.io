I am currently an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Drexel University. I graduated with a Ph.D. in 2013 from the IDEA Lab supervised by [Dr. Sharon Xiaolei Huang](https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/suh972/). My current research interests are computer vision, sparse coding, neuromorphic computing, and multimodal machine learning.  I recieved an NSF CAREER award in 2019.

Academic Lab
======
I run the SPARSE (**SP**iking **A**nd **R**ecurrent **S**oftwar**E**) Coding Lab @ Drexel University.
This lab is inspired by breakthroughs in computational and theoretical neuroscience that incorporate ideas not explored by current feed-forward deep learning architectures.
