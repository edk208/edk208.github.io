permalink: /publication/2020-08-01-drosophila
excerpt: 'We present research in the modeling of neurons within Drosophila (fruit fly) olfaction. We describe the process from data collection, to model creation, and spike generation. Our approach utilizes com- putational elements such as spiking neural networks that employ leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with adaptive firing behavior that more closely mimick biological neurons. We describe the methods of several learning implementations in both software and hard- ware. Finally, we present both quantitative and qualitative results on learning spiking neural network models.'
