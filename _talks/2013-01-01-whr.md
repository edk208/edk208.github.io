wHealth is an interactive storytelling application that can provide insight into a user's willingness to pay for health care, provide insight into how quality information, and compare aggregate rates or perform subgroup analyses, i.e. gender/age/income differences in what factors are most important.  We use gamification techniques such as storytelling, personalization, and immediate feedback to drive user engagement. We are excited to announce that we are the first place winner of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Games to Generate Data Challenge and the recipient of $100,000!
