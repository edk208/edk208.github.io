Spatiotemporal Sequence Memory for Prediction using Deep Sparse Coding. For our project, we sought to create a predictive vision model using spatiotemporal sequence memories learned from deep sparse coding. This model is implemented using a biologically inspired architecture: one that utilizes sequence memories, lateral inhibition, and top-down feedback in a generative framework.
